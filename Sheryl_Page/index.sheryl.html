        <p class="lead">As the COO at the helm of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg juggles the tasks of monetizing the world’s largest social networking site while keeping its users happy and engaged.</p>

    <!--First Paragraph-->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            In April 2019, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg emailed one of Facebook’s cybersecurity teams with a special project. They were to help a Facebook user who had emailed Sandberg to complain about the bullying he was receiving on the social network. People were hacking his account and making fake accounts pretending to be him, then posting in ways that made fun of his disability.

            In previous years, this type of special assignment would’ve been out of the ordinary for Sandberg, the Facebook executive charged with growing the company’s ad business and handling its communications. But after a couple of hard years where Facebook was slammed for prioritizing growth over protecting user data, and for its aggressive stance toward the press, Sandberg has placed a higher priority on user security, privacy and mental health, according to a former employee who knew about her special request.
            
            For Sandberg, the 2010s saw the highest of highs and lowest of lows. She started the decade as a rising female business icon. But as the decade closes, Sandberg is one of the two faces of the company that has come to represent the exploitation of people’s privacy and the hubris of the technology industry


          </div>
          <div class="col">
            When she was hired away from Google to be Facebook’s COO in 2008, Sandberg was 38 — young for the role, but 15 years older than founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

            Zuckerberg brought Sandberg in to be his No. 2, but she also served as the de facto adult in the room for the young company.
            
            Perhaps most importantly, Sandberg was charged with growing Facebook’s revenue and advertising businesses in preparation for an inevitable IPO.
            
            She succeeded handsomely. Before her arrival, Facebook had generated a little more than $150 million in revenue in 2007. Sandberg helped grow that figure nearly 2,400% to $3.7 billion by 2011.
            Sandberg’s handling of the Facebook ad business set up the company nearly perfectly for its 2012 IPO. Upon hitting the public market that May, Facebook raised $16 billion and reached a valuation of $104 billion.

            The next month, Sandberg was rewarded for her work with a position on the Facebook board of directors. She was the first woman to join the board.

            As Facebook grew — the company reached its 1 billionth user in October 2012 — so too did Sandberg’s national profile.

          <div class="col">
            Sandberg seized the moment, and in March 2013, she published “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.” She also established a foundation named after the book to focus on women’s issues in the workplace. (It was later renamed the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation.) The book was a manifesto on women in the workplace, and it was a tremendous success, selling millions of copies and landing Sandberg on magazine covers and TV shows. Although criticism of the book has grown in recent years, especially in regard to its ignorance about minority women in the workplace, “Lean In” catapulted Sandberg into a household name and a role model and icon for women across the globe. But Sandberg’s life took a tragic turn in May 2015. Sandberg’s husband, Dave Goldberg, suffered a coronary arrhythmia and died while the two were vacationing in Punta Mita, Mexico.

          <div class="col">
            In interviews since then, Sandberg has said Goldberg’s death was devastating and caused her to feel huge grief and loneliness. She wrote about how she handled the experience and recovered in a second book published in April 2017 titled “Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy.” Goldberg’s death also helped spark Facebook’s February 2017 move to extend its employees’ bereavement leave to 20 days, a move for which Sandberg was widely praised. Speculation about Sandberg’s political future gained momentum in 2016. Sandberg is a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party and served in the Treasury Department during Bill Clinton’s administration. She was also a supporter of Hillary Clinton, and in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. election, there were reports that Sandberg was in consideration for a Cabinet position if Clinton were elected. Sandberg denied those reports, saying “I really am staying at Facebook.”

    <!--Third Paragraph-->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            At TEDWomen in 2010 Sandberg made the bold decision to talk about the experience of being one of very few women at the C-level of business. She noted that many women, in anticipating having a family, "lean back" from leading at work. After her TED Talk took off, Sandberg wrote the book Lean In, which has spent nearly a year on the New York Times Bestseller list. Sandberg plans to release a version of the book for graduates.
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            Sandberg’s talk focuses on the conundrum of “Why we have too few women leaders”. She summarises her TED talk thus: “My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three. One, sit at the table. Two, make your partner a real partner. And three, don’t leave before you leave.” Ultimately her talk is about keeping women in the workforce and how both the women themselves need to act (by leaning in) and how society needs to treat them.
